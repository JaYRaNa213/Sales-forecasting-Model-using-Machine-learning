# Sales Forecasting Project

This project focuses on building a robust **Sales Forecasting Model** using advanced machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to provide actionable insights for sales predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
  - Transforming raw data into a structured format for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing sales trends and seasonality.
  - Identifying key factors impacting sales.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Creating new features to enhance predictive power.
- **Model Development**:
  - Training machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
  - Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization.
- **Visualization**:
  - Clear and intuitive visualizations of trends, forecasts, and performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for development and visualization.

## Key Insights
1. Seasonal trends and recurring patterns in sales data.
2. Feature importance as derived from model training.
3. Improved prediction accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
